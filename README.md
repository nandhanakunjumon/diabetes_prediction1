# Abstract
Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health concern, and early detection is key to effective management and prevention. This project, PredictWell, is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

 A Random Forest Classifier was used to train the model due to its robustness and ability to handle complex relationships within the data. Important features like glucose levels, BMI, and age were identified as strong predictors of diabetes risk.

The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, confirming its effectiveness in predicting diabetes. The system is integrated into a user-friendly web interface where users can input health data and receive real-time prediction results along with health suggestions.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools in preventive healthcare, empowering users with data-driven insights and encouraging proactive health management.
